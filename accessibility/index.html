<h1>Universal Design</h1>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web Accessibility Initiative</a>, or WAI, is the foundation of making content accessible on the Web. Let's take a look at its main points!</p>

<h2>Regions</h2>

<p>Let's say you've got content you want to present like this:</p>

<div class="example">
    <div class="large">All About Dogs</div>
    There are at least three different kinds of dogs - let's read about them.<br/>
    <div class="large">Dog Types</div>
    &bull; Large<br/>
    &bull; Small<br/>
    &bull; Other<br/><br/>
    [... more content ...]
</div>

<p>It's not particularly helpful if it's not organized. Stripped of any visual styling like spacing, font weight, and font size, it'll read like this:</p>

<code>
    All About Dogs
    There are at least three different kinds of dogs - let's read about them.
    Dog Types
    &bull; Large
    &bull; Small
    &bull; Other
</code>

<p>That's already jumbled together and confusing, and it'd be even worse if it was longer.</p>
