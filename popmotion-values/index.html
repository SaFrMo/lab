<h1>Popmotion Values</h1>

<p>Popmotion <a href="https://popmotion.io/api/value/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">values</a> are an extremely powerful feature of the motion library, but not particularly intuitive. Let's take a closer look at them and see how they work.</p>

<ol>
    <li><a href="step1">First step</a>. A draggable ball that springs back to its starting point on release. Made in idiomatic Popmotion style - very efficient but not easily understood.</li>
    <li><a href="step2">Second step</a>. A rainbow trailing the mouse, each color slower than the last.</li>
</ol>
